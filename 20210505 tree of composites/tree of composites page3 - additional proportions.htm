  <body>
    <br>
    For the range 1 to 210 for n:<br>
    <br>
    additional proportions: (check these for larger primorials)<br>
    <br>
    8/35 numbers have zero prime factors from 2,3,5,7:<br>
    0000 occurs 48/210=8/35 of the time, so 8/35 of numbers don't have
    any of prime factors 2 or 3 or 5 or 7.<br>
    <br>
    46/105=8/35+4/35+2/35+4/105 numbers have one prime factor from
    2,3,5,7:<br>
    1000 occurs 48/210=8/35 of the time, so 8/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and don't have any of prime factors 3 or 5 or 7.<br>
    0100 occurs 24/210=4/35 of the time, so 4/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 3 and don't have any of prime factors 2 or 5 or 7.<br>
    0010 occurs 12/210=2/35 of the time, so 2/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 5 and don't have any of prime factors 2 or 3 or 7.<br>
    0001 occurs 8/210=4/105 of the time, so 4/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 7 and don't have any of prime factors 2 or 3 or 5.<br>
    <br>
    4/15=4/35+2/35+4/105+1/35+2/105+1/105 numbers have two prime factors
    from 2,3,5,7:<br>
    1100 occurs 24/210=4/35 of the time, so 4/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 3 and don't have either of prime factors 5 or 7.<br>
    1010 occurs 12/210=2/35 of the time, so 2/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 5 and don't have either of prime factors 3 or 7.<br>
    1001 occurs 8/210=4/105 of the time, so 4/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 7 and don't have either of prime factors 3 or 5.<br>
    0110 occurs 6/210=1/35 of the time, so 1/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 3 and 5 and don't have either of prime factors 2 or 7.<br>
    0101 occurs 4/210=2/105 of the time, so 2/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 3 and 7 and don't have either of prime factors 2 or 5.<br>
    0011 occurs 2/210=1/105 of the time, so 1/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 5 and 7 and don't have either of prime factors 2 or 3.<br>
    <br>
    13/210=1/35+2/105+1/105+1/210 numbers have three prime factors from
    2,3,5,7:<br>
    1110 occurs 6/210=1/35 of the time, so 1/35 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 3 and 5 and don't have prime factor 7.<br>
    1101 occurs 4/210=2/105 of the time, so 2/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 3 and 7 and don't have prime factor 5.<br>
    1011 occurs 2/210=1/105 of the time, so 1/105 of numbers have prime
    factor 2 and 5 and 7 and don't have prime factor 3.<br>
    0111 occurs 1/210 of the time, so 1/210 of numbers have prime factor
    3 and 5 and 7 and don't have prime factor 2.<br>
    <br>
    1/210 numbers have four prime factors from 2,3,5,7:<br>
    1111 occurs 1/210 of the time, so 1/210 of numbers have prime factor
    2 and 3 and 5 and 7.<br>
    <br>
    8/35+46/105+4/15+13/210+1/210=1<br>
    Accumulate[{8/35, 46/105, 4/15, 13/210, 1/210}]<br>
    output: {8/35,2/3,14/15,209/210,1}<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A024451/A002110<br>
    247/210 = (8/35)*0 + (46/105)*1 + (4/15)*2 + (13/210)*3 + (1/210)*4
    = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7<br>
    without reduced fractions:<br>
    247/210 = (48/210)*0 + (92/210)*1 + (56/210)*2 + (13/210)*3 +
    (1/210)*4 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7<br>
    This gives the average number of distinct prime factors &lt;=
    prime(n)=7 in the natural numbers up to 2*3*5*7=210<br>
