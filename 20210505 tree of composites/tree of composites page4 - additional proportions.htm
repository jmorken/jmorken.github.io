    For the range 1 to 2310 for n:<br>
    <br>
    additional proportions: (check these for larger primorials)<br>
    <br>
    16/77 numbers have zero prime factors from 2,3,5,7,11:<br>
    00000 occurs 480/2310=16/77, so 16/77 of numbers don't have any of
    prime factors 2 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 11.<br>
    <br>
